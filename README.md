# bookings-helper
This extension is a WooCommerce Bookings helper which helps you to troubleshoot bookings setup easier by allowing you to quickly export/import product settings.

All exports will be in JSON file format.

# Global Availability Rules

Importing global availability rules will overwrite all the rules. This is because a bookable product test case will depend on these rules.

# Bookable Product

You can export any specific bookable product and all of its settings including resources and persons.

If resources are defined, importing the bookable product will generate new resources that will be linked to the specific product you imported.
